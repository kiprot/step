      <h2>Kenneth Kiprotich</h2>
      <p> Hey - I am a current student at Columbia University, studying 
          Computer Science. I grew up in Kenya and I am therefore fluent in Swahili, which is 
          my native language. My main interest in tech is skewed towards intellient systems. 
          I hope to explore more in the field(s) of artificial intelligence, and its interface 
          with society. Additionally, I enjoy hiking and running.
      </p>
