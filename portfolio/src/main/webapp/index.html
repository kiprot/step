        <h2> Work </h2>
        <p>•  Summer 2019- Software Developer Intern at BRCK: This summer (2019), I worked at 
            <a href="https://www.brck.com/iot/"> BRCK </a>, an internet-of-things startup in 
            Nairobi, Kenya.</p>
        <p>•  From May to June 2019, I worked on a personal project to introduce some low-
            income high school students in Kenya to coding. The inspiration to do this came 
            mainly from my experience in my first computer science class in college. I attended 
            a public high school without a CS curriculum in Kenya, and experienced first-hand the
          challenges that first-time coders have. To try and "solve" that, I decided to introdice 
          a bunch of tech-enthusiastic kids to some coding!</p>
        <p>•  Columbia University Information Technology: I am a computer lab consultant, part of 
            a team in charge of fixing student's and faculty's hardware and software problems at 
            Columbia's tech hubs.</p>
        <p>•  Summer 2017- Online Banking Intern at Equity Bank:  Worked in a team of four to 
            guide clients through joining the bank’s mobile network and online banking suites so 
            as to ease real- time inter-bank money transfers while also enabling communication 
            through a mobile network. Gained marketing and communication skills from interacting 
            with clients and team members.</p>
